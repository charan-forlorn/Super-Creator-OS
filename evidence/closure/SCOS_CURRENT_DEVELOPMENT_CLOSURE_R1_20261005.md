# SCOS Current Development Closure — Reusable Baseline R1

Date: 2026-10-05
Repository: `C:\Workspace\super-creator-os`
Status: **CLOSED — REUSABLE BASELINE**

## Closure result

The current SCOS development state was reconciled against the live repository, fresh verification was run, the discovered execution/test-harness issues were remediated, and the reusable capability boundary was sealed locally.

Sealed source commit:

`09e26d75e58ab37e47acd2c46d86fe584abfd585`
`chore: seal reusable capability baseline`

Working tree at seal: **CLEAN**  
Remote push: **NOT PERFORMED**  
External deployment/publishing/credential mutation: **NOT PERFORMED**

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Smoke | **16 passed / 0 failed** |
| Security scan | **472 files / 0 findings** |
| Control Center truth gate | **PASS**, live local read-only |
| Python standard population | **3163 passed / 17 skipped / 0 failed / 21 deselected** |
| Python explicit integration population | **19 passed / 2 skipped / 0 failed / 3180 deselected** |
| TypeScript typecheck | **PASS**, 7 workspace projects |
| TypeScript build | **PASS** |
| TypeScript/Vitest | **86 tests passed** |
| git diff --check | **PASS** |

The standard Python population completed with exit code 0 after a 355.29-second run. The explicit integration population completed with exit code 0 after 4.07 seconds.

## Remediation performed

### Test-harness/process collision

Stale duplicate pytest process trees were found from earlier attempts. They were terminated, and the regression was rerun with isolated OS-temporary cache and basetemp directories. The clean rerun passed.

### Generated build drift

The TypeScript build generated tracked `dist/` differences caused by local toolchain output normalization/source-map footer changes. No source defect was identified. Those generated-only working-tree changes were reverted, restoring a clean source tree before sealing.

### Current-source defect result

No production-code defect requiring remediation was identified in this closure round.

## Reusable capability baseline

The durable handoff contract is:

### n8n

`n8n -> HAIOS creative job contract -> SCOS local pipeline -> artifact + QA + provenance`

Canonical boundary:

`integrations/haios_bridge/bridge.py`

Contract:

`HAIOS_SCOS_CREATIVE_JOB_V1`

No direct deep-module import is required when the bridge contract satisfies the job.

### BrightBean

`SCOS render -> artifact validation -> HAIOS execution/evidence -> BrightBean governed delivery`

SCOS remains a producer/validator of media artifacts. BrightBean credentials and publication authority remain outside SCOS.

### Revenue

`SCOS production -> QA -> deterministic commercial/delivery artifacts -> Revenue Ops -> human-controlled customer action`

SCOS does not perform customer communication, payment, billing, CRM synchronization, or autonomous external delivery.

## Explicitly not certified by this closure

This baseline does **not** certify public deployment, external publishing, credential activation, payment, CRM synchronization, or network exposure of the raw-path local MCP media surface.

The local MCP surface at `integrations/mcp/scos_video_mcp.py` remains intentionally excluded from cross-project/network exposure until a dedicated sandbox/allow-list boundary is qualified.

## State transition

`ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT -> VERIFIED CURRENT STATE -> REMEDIATED -> VERIFIED -> SEALED REUSABLE BASELINE`

The baseline is now suitable for reuse by the next project work without reopening SCOS core development unless a new verified requirement or defect is found.

## Durable artifact

Capability contract:

`docs/REUSABLE_CAPABILITY_BASELINE_R1_20261005.md`

Evidence manifest:

`evidence/closure/SCOS_CURRENT_DEVELOPMENT_CLOSURE_R1_20261005.json`

## Correction — 2026-10-09 (Track A push closure)

On 2026-10-09 the Human (JARAN) granted explicit push authority (D3 gate) for this sealed baseline, and the 46 local commits ahead of `origin/main` were pushed fast-forward to remote `main`:

- pre-push remote sha: `2d6a3eae7bd71de82af6c399149d0228cd294060`
- pushed range: `2d6a3ea..c046c22` (46 commits, fast-forward)
- post-push remote sha: `c046c22924e07c003ab9d8fdd663e2e5b845c763` (== local HEAD)
- force: **not used**
- ahead/behind after push: **0 / 0**

This supersedes the `Remote push: **NOT PERFORMED**` line in the dated 2026-10-05 record above; that line is kept intact as the historical milestone record. `External deployment/publishing/credential mutation: **NOT PERFORMED**` remains accurate and unchanged — no publish, deployment, or credential mutation occurred.

Evidence:

- `evidence/production-loop/scos-push-precheck-20261009.json` (read-only pre-push verification, 4/4 PASS)
- `evidence/production-loop/scos-push-execution-20261009.json` (push execution + post-push verification, 3/3 PASS)
